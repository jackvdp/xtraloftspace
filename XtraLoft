Eaton park road L-Shape Loft Conversion

Duration – 11 Weeks

Description:
This project involved a stunning transformation of a terrace Victorian house in Palmers Green, N13. The homeowners envisioned an additional bedroom and a spacious en-suite, which we achieved by designing and constructing L-shape dormers that complemented the style of the house and its existing roof structure.
To maintain harmony with the original aesthetic and surrounding properties, we weathered the dormers using natural slate, carefully matching the original slates. Our team managed every aspect of the project, from the initial construction to the final finishing touches. This included crafting bespoke wardrobes, decorating the interiors, hanging a striking wallpaper on the feature wall, and laying high-quality oak-engineered flooring.
We also took great care to replicate the character of the original staircase, constructing a cut-string staircase and matching all the balustrades. A standout feature of this renovation is the luxurious free-standing bath, positioned thoughtfully in front of the bathroom window, creating a stunning focal point in the en-suite.


Hadley Way Hip to Gable loft Conversion

Duration – 12 Weeks

Description:
This hip-to-gable loft conversion in Winchmore Hill, N21, was a pleasure to bring to life. The project included a complete roof replacement, with the new gable finished in sleek K-Rend render. Given the winter timing of the project, starting in late January, we utilized a tin-hat scaffold temporary roof to ensure smooth progress regardless of the weather.
A key upgrade involved installing a new heating system for the entire house. We cleverly integrated the boiler and cylinder into a service cupboard within the loft, maximizing functionality and convenience for the homeowners. The loft space was further enhanced with the addition of three electric Velux windows, which flood the area with natural light and add a modern touch.
We took care of decorating the entire loft and stairwell using paint colours chosen by the customer, ensuring a personalized and cohesive finish. Impressed with the results, the customers entrusted us with further renovations, including a kitchen and bathroom refurbishment downstairs—projects we were delighted to undertake.

Hadley way Refurbishment

Duration – 8 Weeks

Description:
After completing the hip-to-gable loft conversion, we moved on to transform the rest of the property, ensuring every space was upgraded to the highest standard.
Starting with the bedrooms, we removed the chimney breasts to create additional usable space. The walls were re-drylined, plastered, and freshly decorated to give the rooms a clean and modern look. The upstairs bathroom, in dire need of an upgrade, was refurbished to match the luxurious style of the loft bathroom, using the same high-quality tiles and similar fittings to create a cohesive aesthetic throughout the house.
On the ground floor, we reconfigured the layout by removing the wall between the dining room and the small kitchen, resulting in a spacious open-plan kitchen diner. We installed a sleek Wren kitchen and laid electric underfloor heating (UFH) in the new kitchen area and hallway. To complete the transformation, we fitted premium Amtico flooring throughout the ground floor, adding a sophisticated and durable finish. Finally, we decorated the entire ground floor, leaving the space ready for the customers to enjoy their beautifully modernized home.

Wynchgate Rear Extension

Duration - 15 weeks

Description:
We were delighted to be appointed for a rear extension project in the Southgate area, N14. This extension stood out from others, as it was designed to drop down from the existing floor level of the house, creating a striking architectural feature. To highlight this unique design, we installed a glass balustrade, which offers a gallery-like view into the new kitchen extension.
The extension benefits from an abundance of natural light thanks to the glass gable above the sliding doors and Velux windows in the vaulted roof. These elements also provide impressive ceiling height, making the space feel airy and expansive.
To complement the space, we installed stylish and durable Amtico flooring, adding a premium finish to the new extension. In addition to the main kitchen area, we constructed a downstairs toilet conveniently connected to a new utility room, ensuring practicality without compromising on style. For heating, the new extension is equipped with central heating underfloor heating (UFH), while the existing part of the house was upgraded with elegant new column radiators.


Compton road Hip to Gable Loft Conversion

Duration – 12 weeks

Description:
We recently completed a hip-to-gable loft conversion in the heart of Winchmore Hill, N21, transforming the space into a modern and functional addition to the home. The gable was constructed using yellow stock bricks to seamlessly match the original exterior, maintaining the home’s classic charm.
A standout feature of this loft conversion is the 4.5-meter aluminium sliding doors in the dormer, paired with a full glass Juliet balcony, offering stunning views and flooding the space with natural light. Inside, the new loft includes a sleek, modern three-piece bathroom, complete with a wall-hung Japanese smart toilet, combining luxury and cutting-edge functionality.
To preserve the home’s character, we matched the new staircase to the original, ensuring a cohesive flow between the existing house and the loft. Additionally, all cornices in the new loft were meticulously crafted to replicate the original details, adding a touch of elegance to the space.
The project was completed with a high-quality finish, including decorating throughout and the installation of beautiful oak-engineered flooring, creating a warm and inviting ambiance.


Maze Green Road (bishop Stortford) Loft Conversion

Duration – 10 weeks

Description:
We were brought in to refurbish an existing loft conversion in Bishop's Stortford, which had originally been completed by incompetent builders and required extensive corrective work. Due to the severity of the issues, we had to rebuild the entire loft structure, ensuring it met the highest standards of quality and safety.
To facilitate the work, we installed a tin-hat scaffold to protect the property throughout the extensive reconstruction process. The project included constructing a new gable end, complete with double doors, and installing four brand-new Velux windows to bring in ample natural light. We also replaced the roof with durable clay tiles, ensuring long-term resilience and a premium finish. The gable and dormer faces were completed in white K-Rend for a clean and contemporary look.
Beyond the loft, we addressed numerous remedial works throughout the property to correct poor workmanship left by the previous builders. These improvements not only restored functionality and aesthetic appeal but also gave the homeowners peace of mind.
The customer was extremely happy and content with the transformation, finally able to enjoy a safe, beautifully finished home.


Whitebeam Close Garage Conversion

Duration – 6 weeks

Description:
We transformed a double garage into an exceptional games room while preserving the original exterior for a seamless look. To maintain the traditional aesthetic, we retained the garage doors and constructed internal stud walls. This ensured the exterior appearance of the property remained unchanged while allowing us to reimagine the interior space.
The project involved removing an internal wall and fitting a steel beam to create a spacious open-plan layout. We insulated the walls and floor for comfort and energy efficiency, then screeded the floor and applied a smooth plaster skim for a clean finish.
To complete the transformation, we decorated the space and installed a durable click-system vinyl floor, which added a modern and practical finish. The converted space now serves as a fantastic games room, complete with a custom bar, a pool table, a dartboard, a large TV, and a state-of-the-art sound system. This entertainment hub offers the perfect escape for the homeowners to relax, entertain friends, or watch their favourite sports.
The customers were thrilled with the transformation and delighted to have a stylish and functional space tailored to their needs.

Beehive Road Loft Conversion

Duration – 8 Weeks

Description:
For this project in Goffs Oak, we transformed a bungalow’s loft room into a more spacious and functional living area. To achieve the desired layout, we added a dormer, significantly enlarging the bedroom and creating space for a stylish en-suite bathroom.
The en-suite was fitted with a luxurious four-piece bathroom suite and tiled from floor to ceiling, combining practicality with a sleek, modern finish. The new loft bedroom was fully plastered and decorated, leaving it ready for carpet installation and providing a fresh, inviting space for the homeowners to enjoy.
The exterior of the dormer was weathered using durable brown concrete plain tiles, complemented by a robust three-layer felt system for the dormer’s flat roof. Additionally, we carried out remedial work on the property’s front dormer, ensuring consistency and durability across all external features.
The customer was thrilled with the final result, now a spacious and comfortable retreat that perfectly met their needs.
