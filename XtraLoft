Features to Add:

- Change mini gallery so that it uses images from Instagram (if possible)
- Add about page, which highlghts Jordan's and Tom's

To Do:
- J&T to connect Jack with previous website manager
- Jack to set up domain registration, so it's ready for domain transfer once website is all sorted
- J&T to send curated images over to Jack (put all images in a folder, and name subfolders for each of their purpose e.g. call the usbfolder after a Case Study or after a Service. Then compress the single folder holding everything so that it gives you a single zip file. You can do this by right clicking and ont he folder and clicking compress)
- J&T to send content over to Jack so Jack can make progress on site over the christmas break. (If you can send rough details by Friday 20th that would be fantastic)
