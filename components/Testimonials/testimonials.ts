        quote: "Xtra Loft Space recently completed our loft conversion and full house renovation.\n\nHaving worked with different builders in the past I know choosing the right one can be a big challenge and can come with a lot of fear - from start to finish the service Tom & Jordan provided was first class. For us respect and trust in people are as important as the quality of the build and Xtra Loft Space clearly place these qualities at the heart of their business.\n\nThe work and finish are of the highest standard at what we felt are very fair prices - we are absolutely delighted with this build. Communication was second to none, Tom & Jordan were always available on the phone throughout the process. They accommodated and helped with any concerns we had, always making sure we were satisfied and that we understood all aspects of the process.\n\nEven more impressive, every member of this team works from the same page - Jamie, George, Chris and Archie are all highly skilled and good honest people.The team took care of our home and were kind and trustworthy at all times - to find these qualities in a whole team is extremely rare but we found it here. All the trades Tom bought in also matched expectations and did a great job for us - big thanks to all of them. Special mention to Tom who mainly ran our project day to day and gave everything to make things work for us.\n\nWe cannot recommend Xtra Loft Space highly enough, fantastic builders and great people - choosing them was one of the best choices we made, you won't regret it.\n\nThank you to the whole team for transforming our home - forever grateful!",

        quote: "These guys were absolutely brilliant from start to finish. This was our third house renovation so we've had our fair share of experience with builders. Jordan, Tom and the rest of the team are hardworking, polite, considerate and thoughtful. They worked every single day for 8 months, come torrential rain, snow or 30 degree heat to complete our full house renovation and two story side and rear extension. We lived on site throughout and they were so easy to get on with. They worked to schedule, communicated well with us and our neighbours and kept the site tidy. We have young kids and I really liked how considerate they were around them - absolutely no swearing or smoking on site unlike virtually every other building company! We went on holiday a couple of times during the build and trusted Jordan and the team to keep working in our absence. Nothing was ever too much trouble and we were able to make changes as the build progressed which Jordan was always happy to accommodate. The end result is fantastic. Exactly what we wanted and great finish. I would ðŸ’¯ recommend Xtra Loft Space to anyone.",

        quote: "I highly recommend Xtra loft Space to anyone considering any Building work.\nI only met them by chance when our previous builder let us down.\nWe hired them to build our Loft Extension and within a few months got them back to do the downstairs Rear Extension.\nThey are Honest, Hardworking and above all professional. Everything ran like clockwork from start to finish. They pride themselves on high end perfection and quality workmanship.\nOn a more Personal level, they soon become our friends. Nothing was ever too much trouble and were 100% trustworthy and considerate when working in our home.",

        quote: "We commissioned Xtra loft space to add a 3 metre extension to our home last summer, which also involved installing new kitchen, sliding doors and floor. We are so pleased with the results, and are constantly getting compliments, particularly on the excellent quality of finish. Jordan, Tom and the rest of the team were a pleasure to work with and communication was never an issue. They kept us fully updated on how things were progressing ( we stayed living in the house) and if there were any issues, they would explain upfront, and explain different options before coming to a solution. They always took care to make sure we were happy at various stages and worked with us on adapting the architect's plans in order to squeeze a slightly larger downstairs toilet under the stairs! All the tradesman who they hired in to complete different parts, bricklayers, electricians etc were very professional and pleasant to deal with too. We would definitely recommend them if you want excellent quality builders who won't cut corners!",

        quote: "This year we instructed Xtra Loft Space for a loft conversion, chimney breast removal plus removal of a load bearing wall between the kitchen and dining room (with a new kitchen installation). Based on how good the work was looking, we chose to extend the brief to virtually a whole house refurb (internally and externally) which they were happy to accommodate.\n\nFrom start to finish we knew we were in good hands. Jordan, Tom and the whole team looked after us enabling us to continue living in our home whilst the works were being carried out. Their experience and knowledge from previous projects helped guide us in some key decisions with great results. Managing the various different trades coming in was handled brilliantly by Jordan. It was also very refreshing to be working with the same individuals throughout the build rather than a string of anonymous sub contractors.\n\nXtra Loft Space are a friendly, professional family firm who were very easy to work with - plus we had lots of laughs! We were almost sad to see them go, but obviously delighted that our home was finished to a great standard. They are much more than a loft company and we wouldn't hesitate in using them again or recommending them for your project.",
